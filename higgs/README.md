250000 samples with 33 columns.

- all variables are floating point, except PRI_jet_num which is integer
- variables prefixed with PRI (for PRImitives) are “raw” quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector.
- variables prefixed with DER (for DERived) are quantities computed from the primitive features, which were selected by  the physicists of ATLAS
- it can happen that for some entries some variables are meaningless or cannot be computed; in this case, their value is −999.0, which is outside the normal range of all variables
